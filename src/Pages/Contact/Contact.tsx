        <h2>Reaching Out</h2>
        <p>
          We are a relatively new blog and we hope our users can reach out with
          any suggestion. We will be adding more features and improving the user
          experience as we go. Send us a message through our email
          <a href="#"> blahblahbla@gmail.com</a>. It will be great to hear from
          you.
        </p>
        <h2>Advertising</h2>
        <p>
          Our main focus at this time will be creating valuable content for our
          users. We would still love to hear about your business or product and
          the possibility of us creating a partnership. Send us a message
          through our email at <a href="#"> blahblahbla@gmail.com</a> and put
          advertising in the subject line.
        </p>
        <h2>Coming Soon</h2>
        <p>
          We have many plans for the future of this blog. We will soon start
          sending weekly newsletters to our subscribed users. We will also be
          bringing our content to some or the social media platforms.
